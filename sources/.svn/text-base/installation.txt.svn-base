Software Installation
=====================

Preliminary remarks
-------------------

**Please remember that most of this software is **work in progress, therefore please do not distribute.**

The software used in the NCS group is mainly written in the Python Programming Language. It is easy to learn and is very powerful. Online tutorials for python can be found on `docs.python.org <http://docs.python.org/tutorial/`

The software is designed and essentially used on Linux. It has been reported to work on Mac OS X without considerable difficulty, but is is currently not supported by Windows.

Prerequisites
.............

You first need the following packages

- `python <http://www.python.org>`_
- `python-dev <http://www.python.org>`_

And the following third party modules

- `numpy <http://numpy.scipy.org/>`_
- `matplotlib <http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/>`_
- `scipy <http://numpy.scipy.org/>`_

For real-time vizualization, you will need Enthoughts Chaco Module:

- `Enthought-Chaco <http://www.enthought.com/>`_

If your computer is going to act as a Server (this will be explained later, but probably not), you also need

- fxload

Finally, a nice matlab--style command line is IPython.

- (Optional) `IPython <http://ipython.scipy.org/>`_

These packages can be installed in ubuntu with:

    ``sudo apt-get install python python-dev python-numpy python-matplotlib fxload iPython python-scipy python-enthought-chaco2``

In addition, installing the following packages might be useful for building this documentation

    ``sudo apt-get install python-setuptools python-sphinxbase``

    ``sudo easy_install shpinxcontrib-aafig``

Installation of NCS python packages
...................................

The NCS software can be downloaded directly from their respective repositories. 

- NeuroTools: The spike train analysis currently depends on the NeuroTools_ project developed by the FACETS project. There is a custom Neurotools package with some improvements and bug fixes in our repository. Install with:

    ``svn co https://svn.ini.uzh.ch/repos/avlsi/NCS/SW/NeuroTools_NCS``

- pyST: the python SpikeToolbox Emre_

    ``svn co https://svn.ini.uzh.ch/repos/avlsi/NCS/SW/pyST``

- pyNCS: the python Neuromorphic Cognitive Systems setup module. This packages contains all the objects needed for the setup (Sadique Sheik, Emre_)

    ``svn co https://svn.ini.uzh.ch/repos/avlsi/NCS/SW/pyNCS``

- pyAMDA: this module is required by pyNCS and contains the module to set the biases (Sadique Sheik, Daniel Sonnleitner)

    ``svn co https://svn.ini.unizh.ch/repos/avlsi/ALAVLSI/HW/PCBs/AMDA/Software/PythonInterface/pyAMDA``

- pyAex: This module has the client and servers classes used for Stimulation/Monitoring module the chips and setting the mappings (Emre_)

    ``svn co https://svn.ini.uzh.ch/repos/avlsi/NCS/SW/pyAex``

For installing all the python packages (those starting with py and NeuroTools_) go to the root directory of each package and run

    ``sudo python setup.py install``

This will install the python module to the appropriate place on your system. 

**The following is only needed if your computer is going to act as a server, i.e. it will be directly connected to an AEX board. If you don't know what this means, this means it is probably not required**

- aerfx2 and fx2: the driver for the AEX boards (Daniel_)
- udevamda: the udev rule for the amda boards (Sadique Sheik, Daniel Sonnleitner). you may install the udev rules by running ``make install`` as root in the udevamda directory
