Hardware Usage
==============

Generally you need for actions to deal with networks of spiking neurons. Set the parameters of the neurons, connect it to other neurons, stimulate & monitor, analyze. This section will explain you how to do these using our python interface.

- **Setting up the parameters**: ``ex: ifslwta1.bias.pinj.v=2.86``
- **Addressing:** This part is slightly unintuitive: There are 2 types of addresses which uniquely describes each neuron.

#. 'Human readable address' corresponding to "Synapse Y of Neuron X", noted [[X],[Y]] in python
#. Hardware addresses  corresponding to decimal representations of bits. Basically what the hardware understands, and you don't. 

The pyST_ tool allows you to translate between the two. Other operations are performed by the following python functions:

- **Mapping:** From the pyAex package, ``ex: setmappings(mappings)``, See `setmappings <api.html#pyAex.setmappings>`_
- **Stimulation & Monitoring**: From the pyAex package, ``ex: STAEXIO(stStim)``
- **Spike train visualization and analysis**: from the pyST package, ``composite_plot(stOut)``


.. Required Equipment
   ==================
   
   - The ExCol Mapper (Daniel_)
   - AEX boards for monitoring and sequencing spike trains to the chips (Daniel_)
   - Optional: tmpdiff128 retina on a parallel AER compatible board
   - at least 1 IFSLWTA chip (Giacomo chip) consisting of 128 I&F neurons with 32 synapses each (2 non-plastic exc., 2 inhibitory, 28 plastic synapses implementing the bistable learning synapse) and optional hard-wired "soft Winner-take-all connectivity
   - Optional: 1 2DIFWTA (Elisabetta chip) consisting of 64 x 32 I&F, 3 non-plastic synapses per neuron, 1 inhibitory synapse, 2 excitatory synapses


Powering up the AEX boards
--------------------------

There is a particular power cycle that one must respect:

#. Unplug the USB cables from the AEX boards
#. Power up the AEX boards
#. Wait until the red LED has turned off then plug the USB cable.
#. Turn on the AMDA boards
#. Plug in the USB cables, starting with the AEX board you wish to monitor from (the devices numbers are assigned when the USB cable is plugged in)
#. (Optional) In a setup with a mapper, only the USB cable of the AEX board which is used for monirtoring must be connected, the others can be removed (this saves USB cables).
#. Set the biases on the chip

That should do it. If you have problems ask Emre_ or Daniel_
